## The Story

I was using a library at work and found a confusing section in the documentation. Instead of just complaining, I decided to fix it myself.

The PR was tiny—maybe 20 lines of markdown—but the process taught me:

- How to read and follow contribution guidelines
- The importance of clear commit messages
- How maintainers think about changes
- The value of good documentation

## What Surprised Me

The maintainers were incredibly welcoming. They thanked me for the contribution and gave constructive feedback. This positive experience encouraged me to contribute more.

Since then, I've contributed to several projects and even maintain a small library myself. Open source has been one of the best ways to learn from experienced developers.
