## The Fear

I'd avoided public speaking my entire career. The thought of standing in front of hundreds of people made me physically anxious.

But I had a story worth telling—our microservices migration had hard-won lessons that could help others avoid our mistakes.

## Preparation

I spent three months preparing:

- Wrote and rewrote the talk multiple times
- Practiced in front of colleagues
- Recorded myself and watched (painfully) to improve
- Prepared for questions I hoped nobody would ask

## The Day

The first five minutes were terrifying. My voice shook, my hands trembled.

Then something shifted. I saw people nodding, taking notes. They were engaged. The fear transformed into energy.

## What Changed

The talk led to:
- Conversations with engineers facing similar challenges
- An invitation to write a blog post for a popular engineering blog
- Confidence to share ideas more broadly

Public speaking is still uncomfortable, but I've learned that growth happens outside the comfort zone. I've given several talks since, and each one gets a little easier.
