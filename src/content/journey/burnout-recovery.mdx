## The Signs I Ignored

Looking back, the signs were obvious:

- Dreading work I used to enjoy
- Constant exhaustion despite sleeping
- Cynicism about projects and people
- Difficulty concentrating
- Physical symptoms (headaches, tension)

I kept pushing through, thinking it would pass. It didn't.

## The Breaking Point

I made a significant error in a code review—something I would have caught easily before. That's when I realized something was seriously wrong.

## Recovery

Recovery wasn't quick or linear:

**I took time off.** Actually disconnected, not "working from vacation."

**I set boundaries.** No more late nights as the default. Sustainable pace became non-negotiable.

**I said no more often.** Not every opportunity needs to be seized. Some need to be declined.

**I rediscovered hobbies.** Coding stopped being my only identity.

## What I Tell Others

Burnout isn't a badge of honor. It's a signal that something is broken—in the environment, the expectations, or the boundaries.

Sustainable careers are marathons, not sprints. I'm still learning to pace myself, but I'm much better at recognizing the warning signs now.
