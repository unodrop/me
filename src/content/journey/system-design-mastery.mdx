## The Wake-Up Call

I failed a system design interview badly. I could code well, but when asked to design a large-scale system, I fumbled. I realized I'd been building systems without deeply understanding *why* they were designed that way.

## My Approach

**Studied real architectures.** Read engineering blogs from companies like Uber, Netflix, Stripe. Understanding how real systems evolved was more valuable than theoretical knowledge.

**Practiced deliberately.** Found a study group and practiced designing systems weekly. Getting feedback from others revealed blind spots.

**Started documenting.** Began writing design documents for my own projects, even small ones. The discipline of writing clarified my thinking.

**Asked "why" more.** When encountering architectural decisions at work, I dug into the reasoning. Every system has trade-offs worth understanding.

## The Shift

System design went from my weakest area to one of my strongest. More importantly, I now approach problems differently:

- I think about scale and evolution from the start
- I consider operational concerns alongside features
- I document decisions so future engineers understand the context
- I recognize that there's rarely one "right" answer—only trade-offs

This skill has been invaluable as I've taken on more technical leadership responsibilities.
