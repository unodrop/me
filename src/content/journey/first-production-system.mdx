## What I Learned

This was a humbling experience. My code worked perfectly in development, but production revealed issues I hadn't considered:

- Database connection pooling and timeouts
- Proper error handling and logging
- Monitoring and alerting
- Graceful shutdown and zero-downtime deploys

The first production incident (a memory leak) was stressful but taught me more than months of tutorials ever could.
