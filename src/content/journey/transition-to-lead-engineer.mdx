## The Challenge

The transition was harder than I expected. I was used to being valued for my code output, but as a lead, my impact comes from:

- Making good architectural decisions
- Unblocking team members
- Reviewing code and providing feedback
- Communicating with stakeholders
- Planning and prioritizing work

## Key Learnings

**Write Less Code**: My job is to enable the team to write great code, not to write all the code myself. This was a hard mental shift.

**Document Decisions**: Architecture decisions need to be documented and communicated clearly. I started writing ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) for major decisions.

**Invest in People**: Spending time mentoring junior engineers has a multiplier effect. Their growth is my growth.

**Say No**: Protecting the team from scope creep and unrealistic deadlines is part of the job.

## Growth Areas

I'm still learning how to:
- Balance technical work with leadership responsibilities
- Give constructive feedback effectively
- Navigate organizational politics
- Advocate for the team's needs

Leadership is a continuous learning journey, not a destination.
