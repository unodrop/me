## The Catalyst

A production incident where our microservices got into an inconsistent state made me realize I didn't understand distributed systems well enough. I was building distributed systems without understanding the fundamental challenges.

## What I Studied

- Martin Kleppmann's "Designing Data-Intensive Applications"
- Raft consensus algorithm paper
- Various distributed systems papers from MIT 6.824
- Built a toy distributed key-value store to understand the concepts hands-on

## Impact

This deep dive transformed how I approach system design. I now think carefully about:
- Consistency vs availability trade-offs
- Failure modes and partial failures
- Idempotency and retry logic
- Event ordering and causality

These concepts have been invaluable in every distributed system I've worked on since.
