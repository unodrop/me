## Why I Started

I remembered how lost I felt as a junior engineer. Good mentors accelerated my growth tremendously, and I wanted to pay it forward.

## What I Learned About Teaching

**Explaining reveals gaps.** When I couldn't explain something clearly, it meant I didn't understand it well enough myself.

**Everyone learns differently.** Some people need to see code, others need diagrams, others need to talk through problems verbally.

**Ask, don't tell.** Guiding someone to discover the answer themselves is more effective than just giving them the solution.

**Celebrate small wins.** Progress isn't always visible day-to-day, but looking back over months shows tremendous growth.

## The Multiplier Effect

One of my mentees is now mentoring others. Seeing the knowledge and practices spread through the organization has been incredibly fulfilling.

Mentoring isn't just about helping others—it's made me a better engineer and communicator too.
