title: "Real-Time Analytics Dashboard"
role: "Full-Stack Engineer"
year: 2025
duration: "6 months"
teamSize: 10
outcomeSummary: "Built a real-time analytics platform processing 100K+ events per second with sub-second latency"
overview: "Designed and implemented a real-time analytics dashboard for monitoring user behavior and system health across multiple products"
problem: "Product managers and support teams had no visibility into real-time user behavior. Existing analytics were batch-processed overnight, making it impossible to respond quickly to issues or opportunities."
constraints:
  - "Must handle 100K+ events per second during peak hours"
  - "Query latency must be under 1 second for dashboard updates"
  - "Budget limited to existing infrastructure"
  - "No dedicated data engineering team"
approach: "Built a streaming data pipeline using Kafka for ingestion, ClickHouse for storage and querying, and React for the frontend. Focused on pre-aggregating data at write time to enable fast queries."
keyDecisions:
  - decision: "Choose ClickHouse over traditional OLAP databases"
    reasoning: "ClickHouse offers excellent compression and query performance for time-series data. Its columnar storage is perfect for analytics workloads."
    alternatives:
      - "PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB"
      - "Elasticsearch"
      - "Druid"
  - decision: "Pre-aggregate metrics at multiple time granularities"
    reasoning: "Pre-aggregating at 1-minute, 1-hour, and 1-day granularities allows instant queries regardless of time range selected."
techStack:
  - "React"
  - "TypeScript"
  - "Node.js"
  - "Kafka"
  - "ClickHouse"
  - "Redis"
  - "Docker"
impact:
  metrics:
    - label: "Query Latency"
      value: "< 500ms for 95th percentile"
    - label: "Event Throughput"
      value: "120K events/second sustained"
    - label: "Data Retention"
      value: "90 days at full granularity"
  qualitative: "Product teams now catch and respond to issues within minutes instead of days. The dashboard has become the primary tool for understanding user behavior and making data-driven decisions."
learnings:
  - "Pre-aggregation is essential for real-time analytics at scale"
  - "ClickHouse's materialized views are powerful but require careful schema design"
  - "WebSocket connections for live updates need proper backpressure handling"

## Technical Deep Dive

The key innovation was using ClickHouse's materialized views to automatically pre-aggregate data as it arrives. This eliminated the need for separate aggregation jobs and kept query latency consistently low.

We also implemented a smart caching layer using Redis to handle repeated queries for popular dashboards, further reducing load on ClickHouse.
